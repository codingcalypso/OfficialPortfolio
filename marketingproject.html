          <h2>Project Duration: November 25th, 2024- December 5th, 2024</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            This was a creative project for a marketing campaign with the goal
            of launching a new Decision Intelligence Platform, Data on Demand.
            This initiative involved creating the assets for promoting and
            executing the campaign and ensuring consistent designs across
            multiple platforms. The actionable items I created included: a Press
            Release, a Company Slide Deck, a Linkedin Carousel, a Featured
            Article, and three Email Newsletter templates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >The company name was changed to a generic name and the
              information is purposefully without specific detail about the
              company or competitors.</em
            >
          </p>

          <section class="justify-content-center mt-5">
            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Challenge</h2>

              <p>
                The initial challenge was being given information about a topic
                I was unfamiliar with (AI, the restaurant industry) so I was
                required to do immediate research into these topics to learn
                more and ensure I had a solid foundation before beginning this
                project.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second challenge was to ensure that my communication was
                clear and my designs were professional, visually compelling,
                informative, and value-driven.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Solution</h2>

              <p>
                My solution was to emphasize on the impact that data has on the
                restaurant industry. I chose to focus on three main aspects:
              </p>

              <p>1) What the product can do</p>
              <p>2) Who the product can help</p>
              <p>3) The solution this product provides</p>
              <p>
                By focusing on answering these questions with my creations, I
                would ensure that the documents presented the appropriate
                information.
              </p>
            </article>

            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">My Role</h2>

              <p>
                I self-managed this entire project from start to finish. I
                performed the research, designed the material, and typed up the
                content both from external sources and leveraging the usage of
                AI to assist with the flow of the material and formatting.
              </p>
              <p>
                The project was created in a way that allowed for full creative
                control and decision-making. We were given the opportunity to
                showcase our confidence and creativity in our content and
                designs.
              </p>
            </article>
          </section>
        </div>
        <div class="goals-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Goals:</p>
          <ul class="strategy-list">
            <li>
              Is it clear that research was done on the topics of data
              intelligence, data management, analytics, restaurants, audience
              pricing?
            </li>
            <li>
              Does the work show excitability from the creator about their
              product?
            </li>
            <li>Is the message clear?</li>
            <li>
              What assets did you choose to create and are they realistic for a
              promotion effort?
            </li>
            <li>Did you design something unique?</li>
            <li>Are the assets clean and easy to follow?</li>
            <li>What is the overall grasp of what this product offers?</li>
            <li>How well were the tasks executed?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="strategy-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Strategy:</p>
          The research began with researching competitors to the product. I
          focused on what they were offering but also how they were advertising
          their product.
          <p>
            From there, I began choosing my actionable items to create and begin
            prep work for each. I leveraged ChatGPT to discuss what my ideas
            were and if they fell in line with marketing proposals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I organized each asset by picking one topic to touch on for
            each document, paying attention to not replicate the content on
            multiple creations.
          </p>

          <div class="design-section mt-5">
            <p class="description-title mb-5">Design:</p>
            <p>
              The designs were created utilizing
              <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                >Canva</a
              >
              for ease of use but also the convenience of quick adjustments that
              would be needed. The company would need creations quickly but also
              needed to ensure that edits could be done at a moments notice and
              editable by multiple people.
            </p>

            <p>
              I chose included a main color palette of red, gold, and tan. I
              felt the colors were bold enough to stand out but not too bold
              that they took away from the professionalism of the creations. I
              was also able to add in shades of these main colors for emphasis
              in the designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The design of the assets themselves were based on how quickly and
              efficiently I could showcase my topics. I had specific bullet
              points for each document and I wanted to make sure the content
              showcased the value of the product, was visually enjoyable, but
              also impactful with what the product could do for the consumers .
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="impact-section mt-5">
            <p class="description-title mb-5">Impact:</p>
            <p>
              Overall, the material was well-received by the hiring team with
              emphasis placed on the professionally designed creative pieces and
              properly showcasing the importance of data that this product
              offered.
            </p>
            <p>
              The choice of assets were also praised as they hit the preferred
              advertising platforms and were convenient for the sales team to
              advertise as they were given multiple choices to present the
              information to clients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="whatilearned-section mt-5">
            <p class="description-title mb-5">What I Learned:</p>
            <p>
              One of the most impactful things I learned during this part of the
              program was how important it is to ensure proper documentation of
              impactful areas of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't simply creating a document to "sell" an item. I was
              creating a document that placed hard-hitting, value driven
              information to an audience that needed to quickly understand the
              impact it would have on their business.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew that if I didn't hit the target, then it cause a negative
              ripple effect for the sales team, the customer service team, and
              the product team.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another thing I learned was how to utilize ChatGPT in a way that
              didn't just "give me templates" to copy but to use it as a
              foundation for content creation then edit the verbiage to include
              the details about the company and documentation that I needed. I
              was able to ask multiple questions and parse down their assistance
              to eventually end up with content that was focused, clear, and
              impactful.
