          <p>
            This was the third, and final, project from the Google UX Design
            Professional Certificate. This project was titled "Design for Social
            Good" which is defined as designing a mobile app and website to
            address problems going on in our communities and to drive positive
            change in society. Mental Health is a passion of mine (in multiple
            aspects) so I chose to focus on creating a company that provided
            mental health therapy for low to no-income individuals.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Challenge</h2>

              <p>
                My biggest challenge was to really push myself to design my best
                work so far. Besides my personal challenge, I wanted to make
                sure a mental health therapy app/website was welcoming and
                calming. Seeking support for mental health can be very
                overwhelming and embarassing and I wanted to design content in a
                way that didn't make people feel nervous to do so.

            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Solution</h2>

              <p>
                My solution was to provide a quick and easy way to enroll in
                therapy for mental health suffers. The mobile app and website
                have the same pages, except I added a "FAQ" and "About Us" to
                the website. I chose the colors green (for Mental Health
                Awareness), gold, and brown. I wanted to create more of an
                earthy feel which hopefully invoked the feelings of warmth and
                serenity of being in nature.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">My Role</h2>

              <p>
                My role, the same was before, was that I led the overall user
                experience and front-end development. My responsibilities
                included user research, wireframing/prototyping, testing, and
                design.

        <div class="strategy-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Strategy:</p>
          <p>
            My focus was taking my adjustments I wanted to make on my first two
            projects (color issues, layout simplicity, lack of details) and
            clean those up for this project.
          </p>
          <p>
            My research involved the same assignments as before (personas,
            research study plan, user journey map) and extensive redesigns of
            both projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these assignments are reviewable and are located in my

        <div class="goals-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Goals:</p>
          <p>
            My self-created goals were created, again, by referring back to my
            research documents and peer reviewed assignments.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Focus on peer reviewed/persona pain points</li>
            <li>Make design welcoming but not too flashy</li>
            <li>
              Include individual therapist pages to help users feel more
              comfortable about selecting a therapist
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="design-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Design:</p>
          <p>
            I am very proud of this project! The design is clear, concise, and
            welcoming. I have a page where users can scroll through available
            therapists easily and I included the topics they focus on. I also
            made a design choice to remove the search bar, which was a problem
            in past projects. I had great feedback from my peers about this.
            They felt that by removing the search bar, users would be less
            overwhelmed about what focus to type in, especially if they were
            searching for more than one focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing I had great feedback on was creating individual pages
            for each therapist. I felt this would humanize the therapists by
            explaining more about themselves in hopes to encourage users to
            reach out and my peers agreed. I also made sure these pages were
            scrollable and included booking information for easy sign-ups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, for the website I added the pages of "About Us" and a "FAQ"
            for quick and common questions. I hoped these additions would give
            users a piece of mind about who the company was and what service
            they were considering.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Impact:</p>
          <p>
            If this were a real website, I know the impact for individuals
            suffering from mental health would be great. I specifically chose to
            focus on low to no-income individuals because therapy costs can be
            very expensive. I firmly believe that everyone, regardless of income
            status (or anything else), should have access to mental health care
            any time they need it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As far as the designs, I believe I learned a lot from my first two
            projects. I kept my focus on users without even trying (growth!) and
            went back to my peers numerous times to get feedback on my work.
          </p>

          <p class="description-title mb-5">What I Learned:</p>
          <p>
            These designs turned out so much better than I hoped for. With
            persistence, communication with my peers, and research into users, I
            am very proud of how this project turned out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This 7-course program taught me so much about UX fundamentals,
            inclusive design, low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes, and
            Figma. While I know I am barely scratching the surface of what User
            Experience is, I am astounded at what I did learn. But my journey
            doesn't end here. My curiousity, eagerness to learn, and my drive to
            succeed continue to push me to greater heights and even more
            knowledge.
          </p>

          <p>Thank you for embarking on this design journey with me.</p>
