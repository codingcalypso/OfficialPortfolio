          <br />
          <p>
            This was the second project in the Google UX Design Professional
            Certificate program. This project built on the previous one by
            having me create a responsive website for the fictional company I
            built the mobile app for. The course description was to create a
            website with the Figma frame "Desktop 1440x1024". As a reminder, my
            prompt was "Design an app for an art gallery".
          </p>

            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Challenge</h2>

              <p>
                The initial challenge was deciding if what I had on the mobile
                app should go on the website as well. The other challenges would
                be deciding on the design (working on consistency across
                platforms), deciding to add a footer with all of the links and
                gallery information, and trying to design more with empathy and
                accessibility in mind.

            <article>
              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Solution</h2>

              <p>
                While I kept the pages the same as the mobile app, I made the
                images and text a little larger on the website. I wanted to make
                sure everything was easy to see, especially if users had visual
                disabilities. That is also why I implemented the footer because
                it also had all of the information available for people to read
                through quickly.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">My Role</h2>

              <p>
                My role, the same was before, was that I led the overall user
                experience and front-end development. My responsibilities
                included user research, wireframing/prototyping, testing, and
                design.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Strategy:</p>
          <p>
            I tried to focus more on the website being responsive (although I
            was not as successful as I would prefer) and prioritizing a clear
            and concise website for users. I didn't want the website to be
            something people had to really think through to utilize. I wanted
            their thoughts to be on enjoying the exhibits.
          </p>
          <p>
            I again leaned on my two individual personas I created along with my
            research to continue building this website.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Goals:</p>
          <p>
            Since the goals were set myself, I referred back to my created
            personas to assist in creating my goals.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Design:</p>
          <p>
            I decided to change up the colors for this design but in hindsight,
            I would have preferred to re-work my mobile design colors. My
            thinking was that I would take the gold font from the mobile app,
            lighten it up and make it more pastel, and make that the background
            color so it would be easier on the eyes than a white background. I
            then chose to make the purple button colors from the mobile app the
            main color on my website. My thought process again, still focused on
            being a comfortable and concise website and not being flashy enough
            that it detracted from the exhibits - the real star.
          </p>
          <img
            src="images/project2_img4.png"

        <div class="impact-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Impact:</p>
          <p>
            I hope the impact of this website would be to encourage more
            celebration and importance put on art - both past and present. From
            a business standpoint, I believe this website would benefit an art
            gallery because it would allow artists a bigger platform than simply
            showing their art in a physical location, but it would also provde
            the gallery itself a larger platform and more opportunities to
            interact with fans and find new ways to support their business.

        <div class="whatilearned-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">What I Learned:</p>
          <p>
            This project was done immediately after the mobile app. I put more
            focus on empathetic designs by creating pages that were requested
            from my peers through the individual assignments. I also put more
            effort into creating personas and working harder to provide
            appropriate research (even if it is fabricated). The users were my
            main focus and I hope it is seen in this design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In hindsight, like I mentioned before, I think the colors could use
            a little more to better match the mobile app and perhaps some user
            flow tweaks. But, I am still learning Figma and I couldn't quite
            figure out how to do a few things I wanted to do (like a "messages"
            page that features new exhibits or messages from another user. Is
            that even possible in Figma?).
