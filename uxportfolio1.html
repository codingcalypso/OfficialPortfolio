            and I was to design a mobile app for them.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Challenge</h2>

              <p>
                The initial challenge is that there are a lack of online apps
                for smaller art galleries to exhibit their exhibits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second challenge was to ensure that those with visual or
                physical disabilities could view the online app easily.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">Solution</h2>

              <p>
                My solution wasn't simply to create an app for an art gallery. I
                also wanted to focus on those individuals who are unable to
                attend art galleries due to various disabilities. I focused on
                image sizes, clean and clear designs, and easy to click buttons
                and links.

              <h2 class="text-uppercase fw-bold">My Role</h2>

              <p>
                I led the overall user experience and front-end development. My
                responsibilities included user research,
                wireframing/prototyping, testing, and design.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Strategy:</p>
          <p>
            Being mobile friendly was my only concern at the moment. This meant
            prioritizing ideas and designs that fit on mobile phones
            specifically, not expanding designs to other screen sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The research was done through peer reviewed assignments. I would
            submit my Google template that featured my questions and users would
            review it, answer the questions, and then grade my assignment. I
            then input their information in my templates for research where I
            created two individual personas, a research study plan, and user
            journey map.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these assignments are reviewable and are located in my
            <a

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Goals:</p>
          <p>
            Since I set the goals myself, I used my created personas to
            determine what I thought each person would like to see. I also
            reviewed my User Journey Map and Research Study Plan from my
            <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L9JgIGwSJ8XkTjcMMnf-7ch7r6iSMZcqnvhD3SFRwHE/edit?usp=sharing"

            to help refine my goals. I set the goals of this project as the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Clean, efficient design</li>
            <li>Accessible to visual and physical disabilities</li>
            <li>Being welcoming and informative</li>
            <li>Allowing limited personalization</li>
          </ol>
          <img
            src="images/project1_img3.png"
            alt="Initial Mockup of App Pages"
            class="img-fluid mb-5 rounded"

        <div class="design-section mt-5">
          <p class="description-title mb-5">Design:</p>
          <p>
            The design grew as I went through the design course. It started as a
            simple, 3 slide presentation and grew into 7 slides. I wanted to
            have a little fun and design the app in a way that allowed users to
            "favorite" and "share" exhibits and have their own profile that
            featured the exhibits they favorited. It could help show off a
            little bit of the users personality but I also thought these could
            also be considered "conversation starters" so users could eventually
            connect with eachother in a few different ways within the app.
            Unfortunately, I didn't have the skills to figure out how that could
            be made into a reality, but the thought was there.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">Impact:</p>
          <p>
            While I don't have any official stats, given that this is all
            fictional, I will say I think the impact would be good for the art
            gallery. Many galleries are small and don't have the technical
            resources to build their own app/website let alone update it when
            new exhibits come to their gallery. I think more of these would not
            only benefit viewers who are unable to visit many art galleries in
            person, but it would give these art galleries more of an audience
            and then hopefully, more support for the artists.

          <p class="description-title mb-5">What I Learned:</p>
          <p>
            One of the most impactful things I learned during this part of the
            program was how important it is to design with the user in the front
            of my mind. Even though I thought I was always an empathetic
            designer, I quickly realized how often I actually designed with my
            own implicit biases. This was an immediate focus for me to
            prioritize growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other things I learned were beginner design creation in Figma,
            how to communicate design and development challenges with my team
            (aka my peers), and how important the research process is, not only
            before you begin designing, but through repeated testing and
            refining.
